# App.jsx

The template already has a lot in it, to show some basic features.

Let's reduce it to the bare minimum.

You can delete everything in `App.jsx` and replace it with:

```javascript
import './App.css'

const App = () => {
  return (
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
  )
}

export default App
```

This is about as basic as a **React Component** can get.
