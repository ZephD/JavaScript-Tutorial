# React

The JavaScript library for **building UI** by creating reusable **Components**.

It lets you describe UI as a tree of components using **JSX** (HTML-like syntax).

React manages the updating of the UI efficiently when data changes.

React uses as internal Virtual DOM (a light-weight copy of the real DOM) to determine changes
and if the real DOM needs updating.

# React-Dom

React-DOM is a companion library that bridges React with the browsers Document Object Model (DOM).

It takes the React components you write and transform them into actual HTML elements on the page.

It also handles updating the DOM efficiently when the React Virtual DOM changes.
