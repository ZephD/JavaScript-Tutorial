# Comments

## End-of-Line Comment

As the name suggests, can be put at the end of a line, after code.

```javascript
// End-of-Line Comment
```

These are used liberally.

## Block Comment

```javascript
/* Block Comment */
```

```javascript
/*
*  Block Comments
*  can be multi-line
* */
```

Can even be put in the middle of a line of code!

## Javascript Documentation

Often placed above functions, to describe them.

```javascript
/**
 * JS Documentation
 * @param input
 * @returns output
 */
```
